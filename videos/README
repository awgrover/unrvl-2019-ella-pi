Put your movies in here.
They must be .mp4
Each name of a movie begins with a number, like 0-Candle.mp4.
That corresponds to the touch pin order (A0 == 0, etc.).
The "idle" movie (when nothing is touched), should have a "9", like 9-Idle.mp4.

We are using the omxplayer on the rapsberry-pi, and it can only handle certain kinds of mp4, I used "WinFF" and the default settings to re-encode as mp4. That seems to work reliably.
